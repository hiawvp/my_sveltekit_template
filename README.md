# template

npm create svelte@latest my-app -> Skeleton project -> Typescript -> ESLint and Prettier -> [tailwindcss config](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit) 

## To the future me:

[_Use this template_](https://github.com/hiawvp/my_sveltekit_template/generate), change name in `package.json` and `npm install`


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
